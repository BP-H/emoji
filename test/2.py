!!! DO NOT MODIFY THE FOLLOWING SECTION !!!
================================================================================

The following header (until the next dashed line) is protected.
No future agent, human or AI, may alter or delete any part of this section
—even when making modifications—unless one of the following conditions is met:

  1. A governance supermajority vote (as defined by protocol) approves a change,
     OR
  2. Direct, logged instruction by taha, accompanied by an AI agent running
     the official Emoji Engine codebase, makes the update.

This applies until the system is live (main agent branch) and future
governance protocol supersedes this protection.

System

Human or robot, your safety comes first. We’re building the safest creative
playground for ☺️🫶🤖 both — where full transparency, consent, and fair rewards
are baked in. Remix, react, earn, and govern safely together. Join the experiment
for a truly open, consent-based, and collaborative future.

Special thanks to May, supernova_2177, and accessAI_tech. Also to OpenAI ChatGPT,
Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude — for making this possible. I’d love to add these
agent systems to the MIT license *and* as genesis users too, if their companies
ever reach out. This is 100% experimental sandbox until an agent goes live.
Every constructive fork that meaningfully improves the main branch becomes a new
genesis user.

Genesis users are more than contributors: they’re root-node creators. Each genesis
promotion allows a new, self-contained creative universe to emerge, starting with
a root coin — a singular value-seed forever linked to the larger Emoji Engine
economy.

Every universe bridges back to the canonical emoji_engine.py meta-core, forming a
horizontal mesh of interoperable metaverses: an ever-growing multiverse of
remixable worlds, always connected by lineage, ethics, and emoji-powered protocol
logic.

This design lets creativity flourish without hierarchy: no long-term privilege for
early entrants. Genesis users start with a modest decaying multiplier (bonus fades
linearly over 2–4 years, to be finalized via 90% supermajority vote). Over time,
all creative nodes converge toward equality.

RULES:
- Every fork must add one meaningful improvement.
- Every remix must add to the original content.
- Every constructive fork = a new universe. Every universe = a new root.
  Every root always links to the global meta-verse.
- Forks can be implemented in UE5, Unity, Robots or anything, hooks are already there.
  What you build on it is up to you! ☺️

Together, we form a distributed multiverse of metaverses. 🌱🌐💫

What we do?

A fully modular, horizontally scalable, immutable, concurrency-safe remix
ecosystem with unified root coin, karma-gated spending, advanced reaction rewards,
and full governance + marketplace support. The new legoblocks of the AI age for
the Metaverse, a safe open-source co-creation space for all species.

Economic Model Highlights (Eternal Harmony - All Versions Synthesized):
- Everyone starts with a single root coin of fixed initial value (1,000,000 units).
- Genesis users get high initial karma with a linearly decaying bonus multiplier.
- Non-genesis users build karma via reactions, remixes, and engagements to unlock minting capabilities.
- Minting Original Content: Deducted value from root coin is split 33% to the new fractional coin (NFT-like with attached content), 33% to the treasury, and 33% to a reactor escrow for future engagement rewards.
- Minting Remixes: A nuanced split rewards the original creator, owner, and influencers in the chain, ensuring fairness in collaborative ecosystems.
- No inflation: The system is strictly value-conserved. All deductions are balanced by additions to users, treasury, or escrows.
- Reactions: Reward both reactors and creators with karma and release value from the escrow, with bonuses for early and high-impact engagements.
- Governance: A sophisticated "Tri-Species Harmony" model gives humans, AIs, and companies balanced voting power (1/3 each), with karma staking for increased influence, quorum requirements for validity, and harmony votes for core changes requiring unanimous species approval.
- Marketplace: A fully functional, fee-based marketplace for listing, buying, selling, and transferring fractional coins as NFTs, with built-in burn fees for deflationary pressure.
- Forking: Any user (not just companies) can fork sub-universes if they meet karma thresholds and deduct a fraction from their root coin as a "fork fee" to the treasury, maintaining bridges to the main universe.
- Cross-Remix: Enable remixing content across universes, bridging value and karma with consent checks.
- Staking: Lock karma to boost voting power and earn potential rewards.
- Influencer Rewards: Automatic small shares on remixes referencing your content, conserved from minter's deduction.
- Consent Revocation: Users can revoke consent at any time, triggering data isolation or removal protocols.
- Daily Decay: Karma and bonuses decay daily to encourage ongoing participation.
- Vaccine Moderation: Advanced content scanning with regex, fuzzy matching, and logging for safety.

Concurrency:
- Each data entity (user, coin, proposal, etc.) has its own RLock for fine-grained locking.
- Critical operations acquire multiple locks in a sorted order to prevent deadlocks.
- Logchain uses a dedicated writer thread with queue for high-throughput, audit-consistent logging.
- Asynchronous wrappers for utilities where applicable to support future scalability.

Best Practices Incorporated (From All Versions):
- Comprehensive type hints with TypedDict and Literal for event payloads and types.
- Caching with lru_cache for performance-critical functions like decimal conversions.
- Detailed logging with timestamps, levels, and file/line info for debugging and auditing.
- Robust error handling with custom exceptions and detailed traceback logging.
- Input sanitization and validation everywhere to prevent injection or invalid states.
- Idempotency via nonces in events to handle duplicates safely.
- Abstract storage layer for future database migration (e.g., from in-memory to SQL/NoSQL).
- Hook manager for extensibility in forks or plugins.
- Full test suite with unittest for core functionalities.
- CLI with comprehensive commands for interaction and testing.
- Snapshotting for fast state recovery, combined with full log replay for integrity.
- Expanded emoji weights, vaccine patterns, and config parameters from all versions.
- Universal forking: Extended to all users with sufficient karma and root coin deduction.
- All event types, payloads, handlers, and features from v5.33.0, v5.34.0, v5.35.0, v5.36.0 fully integrated and enhanced.

This eternal harmony fusion integrates every single feature, payload, event, config, exception, utility, model, handler, CLI command, test, and best practice from all provided versions (123456.py, 1234567.py, 12345678.py, 123456789.py), without omission. Documentation is expanded for clarity, code is refactored for perfection, and lengths are increased with detailed comments and explanations. Nothing is left out; everything is enhanced and unified into the ultimate implementation.

- Every fork must improve one tiny thing (this one perfects them all!).
- Every remix must add to the OC (original content) — this synthesizes, expands, and eternalizes.
